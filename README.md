## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- ✅ Unit Testing (Jest, PyTest)
- ✅ Integration Testing
- ✅ End-to-End Flows (Cypress)
- ✅ Performance Testing (Locust – pending simulation data)
- ✅ Fault Handling (graceful degradation: fallback if AI or blockchain fails)

---

## 📈 Deployment Strategy

- 🐳 Containerized microservices via **Docker**
- ☁️ Cloud-native deployment on **AWS EKS**
- 🔁 Auto-scaling enabled (horizontal scaling for services)
- 📦 Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform** (in progress)
- 🧩 Modular system for plug-and-play microservices

---

## 🛡️ Reliability & Monitoring

- 🔍 Error handling with user-friendly feedback
- 📊 Real-time dashboard with metrics: transaction volume, latency, uptime
- ⚠️ Automated alerts for failures or service degradation
- 🔐 Secure data handling & tokenized user sessions
